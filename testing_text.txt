Here is a list of stuff to test in text support:

- A font that has letters that overlap adjacent letters horizontally, like Italianno. Some letters, like "g" in Italianno can even overlap two characters. When selecting a letter, parts of letters that aren't selected but overlap the selection should probably be drawn the selection color.
- Bidi text, including wrapping
- Rendering and editing Devanagari, like कि, which this page gives as an example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_text_layout
- That antialiasing uses linear blending, not the stupid sRGB blending.
- Emoji
- Font fallback
- A font with ligatures
- That the text cursor can go inside the ligature and that each letter in the ligature can be individually selected.
- A ligature with individual letters colored differently.
