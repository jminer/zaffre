## Testing Fonts

There are two fonts that tests rely on: DejaVu Sans and Italianno. DejaVu Sans is a standard font
with good language support that isn't shipped with Windows or Mac. (Some of the fonts that ship with
Windows have hacks in them that could cause the metrics to vary if they were used on Linux; they
aren't suitable for use with tests.) Italianno has metrics and overlaps that most fonts don't. And
both are freely available.
